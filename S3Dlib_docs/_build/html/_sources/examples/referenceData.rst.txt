The original image was obtained from the
`GRAIL Primary Mission Gravity Maps 
<https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/4014>`_ 
page in NASA Scientific Visualization Studio.
Using Photoshop, the green and blue channels were darkened in the areas between 50 km to 60 km, which
were originally colored toward white in the image (see link).  This was done to  have hue as the
scale indicating thickness.  Hence the upper bound was clipped at 50 km.

The image originated from
`Expanse of Ice  
<https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08389>`_ 
page in JPL and NASA Photojournal website. Using Photoshop, multiple operations
were performed on the image.  A two pixel horizontal slice was extracted and then
vertically expanded.  Using the 'Original Caption Released with Image' information from the webpage, the
pixels in the ring gaps were identified and made transparent.  The image was rotated
90 degrees, with the outer ring at the image bottom.  Finally, the image was resized
and saved to a png file format. From the image information, the extent of the ring
in the image was from 74,000 km to approximately 140,220 km.

The original image was from :raw-html:`200&deg;` ultra-widefield retinal imaging (960x240).  
Since the intended usage was a projection over :raw-html:`180&deg;`, 96 pixels were removed
from the image width and then saved in png file format.
